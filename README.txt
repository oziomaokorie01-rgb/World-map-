Espresso Systems World Map - README

This package includes a dark-themed Leaflet map with Espresso branding and 9 events (past & future). The ZIP contains:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- images/ (logo, favicon, markers, and placeholder images)

How to use:
1. Unzip and deploy on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or open index.html locally.
2. Replace images in /images with your real photos (keep filenames or update script.js).
3. The map uses Carto Dark tiles (no API key).

If anything is missing or you want globe view added later, tell me and I'll update the package.
